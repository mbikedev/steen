# Language Column Fix Summary

## Problem
The DATA-MATCH-IT page was failing with multiple errors:
```
Error: Could not find the 'language' column of 'residents' in the schema cache
```

## Root Cause
Your database schema included the `language` column in the TypeScript types but the actual database table was missing this column.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Database Migration (007_add_language_column.sql)
- Adds the missing `language` column to the residents table
- Includes automatic language mapping based on nationality
- Adds proper indexing for performance

### 2. API Service Resilience (api-service.ts)
- Modified `createResident()` to gracefully handle missing language column
- Modified `updateResident()` to gracefully handle missing language column
- Both functions will retry without language field if column doesn't exist

### 3. DataContext Improvements (DataContext.tsx)
- Made language field handling more robust
- Added conditional inclusion of language field

## Next Steps

### To Fix Immediately:
1. **Apply the migration** using the instructions in `APPLY_DUTCH_HEADERS_MIGRATION.md`
2. **Run migration 007** first, then 006 if you need CSV import compatibility

### After Migration:
- Your DATA-MATCH-IT page will work normally
- Language auto-fill will work based on nationality
- All existing functionality will be preserved

## Migration Files
- `supabase/migrations/007_add_language_column.sql` - Fixes the missing column
- `supabase/migrations/006_add_dutch_column_view.sql` - Adds CSV import compatibility

## Verification
After applying the migration, the following should work:
- ✅ Adding residents via paste/Excel import
- ✅ Editing resident information
- ✅ Language auto-fill based on nationality
- ✅ All existing DATA-MATCH-IT functionality

The app will continue to work even before the migration due to the resilience fixes in the API layer.
