# URGENT: Deploy Resident Photos Backend

## Issue ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED
~~Images disappear on page refresh because the backend isn't deployed yet.~~ **localStorage fallback now working!**

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Images persist through page refreshes (localStorage)
- ✅ Upload functionality working
- ⏳ Database storage pending backend deployment

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Create Database Table
1. Go to your Hostinger **hPanel**
2. Navigate to **Databases → phpMyAdmin**
3. Select your database: `u734544155_mikaty`
4. Click **SQL** tab
5. Copy and paste the content from `create_resident_photos_table.sql`
6. Click **Go** to execute

**Database Details:**
- Host: `localhost`
- Database: `u734544155_mikaty`
- User: `u734544155_oscar`
- Password: `2#^HT?v2kI`

### Step 2: Upload PHP Backend Files

You need to upload these files to your Hostinger server:

#### Files to Upload:
1. **Replace** `public_html/api/php/index.php` with the updated version
2. **Upload new** `public_html/api/php/resident-photos.php`
3. **Create directory** `public_html/api/php/uploads/`
4. **Create directory** `public_html/api/php/uploads/resident-photos/`
5. **Upload** `public_html/api/php/uploads/.htaccess`

#### Via Hostinger File Manager:
1. Login to your Hostinger hPanel
2. Go to **Files → File Manager**
3. Navigate to `public_html/api/php/`
4. Upload the files listed above
5. Set directory permissions to **755** for uploads folders

#### Via FTP (if you prefer):
- Host: Your Hostinger FTP details
- Upload to: `/public_html/api/php/`

### Step 3: Test Deployment

After uploading, test the endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://mikaty.eastatwest.com/api/php/index.php?endpoint=resident-photos" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: 20a33dfcc5ba2c2bfebec361a1c1d2e167462a7b00443f8b8181bf07d9a6c50a"
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {},
    "count": 0
}
```

**Current response (before deployment):**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Steen API is running",
    "endpoints": {
        "test-connection": "index.php?endpoint=test-connection",
        "residents": "index.php?endpoint=residents",
        "test": "index.php?endpoint=test"
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Verify in App

1. Refresh the Residents Grid page
2. Upload an image
3. Refresh the page again
4. **Image should persist** (not disappear)

## Files Ready for Upload

All files are already created in your local project:
- ✅ `api/php/index.php` (updated)
- ✅ `api/php/resident-photos.php` (new)
- ✅ `api/php/uploads/.htaccess` (new)
- ✅ `create_resident_photos_table.sql` (for database)

## ✅ How It Works Now (Updated)

**Current app logic (localStorage working):**
1. **Try** to upload to database → **Fails** (backend not deployed)
2. **Fallback** to localStorage with base64 → **Works permanently**
3. **Page refresh** → **Load from localStorage** → **Image persists**

**After backend deployment:**
1. **Upload to database** → **Success** (backend available)
2. **Store in MySQL with file system** → **Professional storage**
3. **Page refresh** → **Load from database** → **Image persists everywhere**
4. **Multi-device access** → **Images available on all devices**
5. **Server optimization** → **Better performance and backup**

## Priority: MEDIUM ⬇️
~~Without backend deployment, no images will persist across page refreshes.~~
**UPDATE**: localStorage now provides persistence. Backend deployment enables:
- Multi-device image access
- Server-side image optimization
- Better performance for large datasets
- Permanent backup and recovery
