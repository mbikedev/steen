# ✅ Dashboard Stats Fix - "Totale Bewoners" Count Issue

## Problem Fixed
The "Totale Bewoners" count on the dashboard was showing stale data (showing 50 residents even after all were deleted) because:

1. **Dashboard stats weren't refreshed** after resident operations (create/delete)
2. **Query was too restrictive** - only counting residents with `status = 'active'` instead of all residents
3. **No fallback mechanism** when dashboard stats failed to refresh

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard Stats Query (`lib/api-service.ts`)
```sql
-- BEFORE (too restrictive)
SELECT id, status FROM residents WHERE status = 'active'

-- AFTER (counts all residents)  
SELECT id, status FROM residents
```

### 2. Added Stats Refresh to CRUD Operations (`lib/DataContext.tsx`)

**After Creating Residents:**
- ✅ Refreshes dashboard stats automatically
- ✅ Includes error handling with fallback values

**After Deleting Residents:**
- ✅ Refreshes dashboard stats automatically  
- ✅ Includes fallback calculation if API fails
- ✅ Updates count immediately

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added try/catch blocks around dashboard stats refresh
- Implemented fallback calculations when API fails
- Added detailed logging for debugging

## Code Changes Made

### File: `lib/api-service.ts`
- **Line 654**: Removed `.eq('status', 'active')` filter to count all residents
- **Line 667**: Updated comment to clarify counting logic

### File: `lib/DataContext.tsx`  
- **Lines 330-337**: Added dashboard stats refresh after `createResident`
- **Lines 420-435**: Added dashboard stats refresh after `deleteResident`
- **Lines 427-434**: Added fallback stats calculation for resilience

## Result
- ✅ **Accurate counts**: Dashboard now shows correct resident count in real-time
- ✅ **Immediate updates**: Count updates instantly after adding/deleting residents  
- ✅ **Resilient**: Works even if dashboard stats API fails
- ✅ **Zero data**: Shows 0 residents when all are deleted (no more stale "50" count)

## Testing
The fix handles these scenarios:
1. ✅ Adding residents → count increases immediately
2. ✅ Deleting residents → count decreases immediately  
3. ✅ Deleting all residents → shows 0 (not stale count)
4. ✅ API failures → falls back to calculated values
5. ✅ Page refresh → loads correct count from database

**No breaking changes** - all existing functionality preserved.
