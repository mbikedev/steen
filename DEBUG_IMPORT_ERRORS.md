# Debug Import Errors Guide

## Current Error: Empty Object `{}`

The error you're seeing (`Error in addToDataMatchIt: {}`) indicates that error details are being lost. I've now improved the error logging to show you exactly what's failing.

## What to Do Next

### 1. Try the Import Again
After the improved error logging, try pasting your data again. You should now see detailed error information like:

```javascript
Error in addToDataMatchIt: {
  error: {...},
  message: "value too long for type character varying(20)",
  code: "22001",
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  residentBadge: 12345,
  residentData: {
    badge: 12345,
    firstName: "John...",
    lastName: "Smith...", 
    room: "Very Long Room Name That Exceeds Limit",
    nationality: "Netherlands"
  }
}
```

### 2. Check the New Console Output
Look for these specific error messages:

**Language Column Missing:**
```
Language column not found, retrying without language field
```

**Data Too Long:**
```
Data too long error, attempting to truncate fields
Retrying with truncated data: {
  original_room_length: 35,
  truncated_room_length: 20,
  original_room: "Very Long Room Name That Exceeds",
  truncated_room: "Very Long Room Name"
}
```

### 3. Apply Database Migrations
The best solution is to apply the database migrations:

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor** 
3. **Run these migrations in order:**
   - `007_add_language_column.sql`
   - `008_fix_column_lengths.sql`
   - `006_add_dutch_column_view.sql`

### 4. Temporary Workarounds (If You Can't Apply Migrations Yet)

The improved error handling will now automatically:
- ✅ Remove language field if column doesn't exist
- ✅ Truncate long room names to 20 characters
- ✅ Truncate long OV numbers to 50 characters
- ✅ Truncate long register numbers to 50 characters
- ✅ Truncate long reference person names to 200 characters

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Before (Empty Error):
```
Error in addToDataMatchIt: {}
```

### After (Detailed Error):
```
Error in addToDataMatchIt: {
  message: "value too long for type character varying(20)",
  code: "22001", 
  residentBadge: 12345,
  room: "Room name that is too long for database"
}

Data too long error, attempting to truncate fields
Retrying with truncated data...
✅ Resident 12345 added successfully (with truncated room name)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Try the import again** - you should now see detailed error information
2. **Check the console** for the specific error messages
3. **Apply the database migrations** for a permanent fix
4. **Report back** with the new detailed error messages if issues persist

The app will now handle the errors gracefully and provide much better debugging information!
