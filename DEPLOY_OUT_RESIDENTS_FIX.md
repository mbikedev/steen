# Deploy OUT Residents Fix

## Issue Fixed

The OUT residents API was failing because after moving a resident to the OUT table, it was trying to fetch the newly created record using `getOutResident()` which was failing. The fix changes the response to return the resident data directly without the additional database query.

## Deployment

Upload the fixed `out-residents.php` file from `out-residents-fix.zip` to replace the existing file on the server at:
`/public_html/api/php/out-residents.php`

## What Changed

- Modified the `moveResidentToOut()` function to return success immediately after the transaction
- Removed the problematic `getOutResident($db, $newOutId)` call that was causing "OUT resident not found" error
- Now returns the resident data directly using the `formatOutResident()` function

## Testing

After deployment, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://mikaty.eastatwest.com/api/php/index.php?endpoint=out-residents" \
     -H "X-Api-Key: 20a33dfcc5ba2c2bfebec361a1c1d2e167462a7b00443f8b8181bf07d9a6c50a" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"residentId":123}'
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Resident successfully moved to OUT",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "badge": 25159,
    "firstName": "Adhanom Measho",
    "lastName": "Gebremaraim",
    ...
  }
}
```
